      <h1>About this site</h1>
      <p>I created this site as a place to work on my coding skills and thought it would be fun to work with Guild
          Wars 2 Web API since I am a long time GW player. I have started to published pages for this site, but I just
          want to be clear that the GW2 section may never be fully realized. With that being said, the accuracy of the
          open data provided and data retrieved by use of a GW2 API key will be as accurate as the GW2 source iteself.</p>
      <p>My practices and policy about your data is that:
        <ul>
          <li>At this time, this site will not load any cookies onto your machine.</li>
          <li>Also at this time, this site does not store any of your data at all. This includes the key you use to retreive your
              account data and the data retrieved using the key.</li>
          <li>And if and when I ever decide to store any data I will make it known here and I will commit to never selling,
              trading, renting, or give away for free any Guild Wars 2 API keys or any data retrieved using those keys.</li>
          <li>The only way I would ever provide anyone your data is if instructed to by a court order.</li>
      </ul>
